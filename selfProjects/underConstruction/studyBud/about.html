      <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
      <p>We never fail, we learn and move on. This is what life is all about.
          Many of us, more so than ever, are discovering how fun self-learning can be.
          You set your own limits, set your own goals and most importantly learn what
          is interesting to you. The only problem can be sharing that enthusiams with others
          when their interests are not the same, similar, or even in the same ballpark.</p>

        <p>We understand that you want to discuss your topics with people without seeing them
          glaze over as you explain the differences between JavaScript's promises and callbacks, Russian's
          accusative and genative case or even knitting's knit and pearl.</p>

          <p> We want you to have someone in your life who's just as excited or eager to know more, progress and
            achieve goals quicker with a firmer grasp. Getting smarter. Together.</p>
