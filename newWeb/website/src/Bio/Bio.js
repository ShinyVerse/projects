    I started off as a self-taught developer while working in the health sector.
    My next chapter led me to becoming a student at Maker's academy (a 16 week intensive bootcamp), where I learnt
    best practices such as the SOLID principles, OOD, and TDD. Once graduating, I helped out on site for a while
    helping as an assistant coach with some fellow graduates. Next came my first taste of being a software Developer
    with a company called Global Relay. Here I helped to create a new API for the messenger team.
    Passions for Frontend and all things Javascript have led me away from this company and I'm now seeking my next role.
