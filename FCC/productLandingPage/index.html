      <h1>What We're all About...</h1>
      <p id="about-us">City life is hard. Few open spaces, everyone in a rush and the feel of time ticking away in your free time dominates you almost entirely.
        That's where Be A BumpKing comes in. We offer you a hands-on getaway. We invite you to come help us out with the farming, taking care of the
        farm animals and getting your hands back into nature while breathing some sweet fresh air. We ask a simple price for where you'll be staying
        and any further donations to the upkeep of the animals are welcome. Food is homeground and prepared by us. We promise you'll find something
        which brings you back down to Earth and to the moment.
